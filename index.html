                    <p>I’m a student who likes to work on projects where I start from scratch and build something up. In the process I like to learn new things and work towards a final goal. For example, soldering, 3d modeling and laser cutting. In these
                        projects I like to involve technologies I think are interesting and relevant to the plan. This way I both explore the technologies and see their capabilities, while creating something that looks both nice and is practical. Another
                        way I do this is by trying to fix broken objects of mine myself, for example lenses. </p>
                    <p>I’m also very into photography and recently got into film photography, I would love to use these skills to showcase my upcoming projects! I think photography really helps with envision and placing products as its very visual and requires
                        attention to details, perspectives and composition. Other than that, I like editing and working on graphical design as well as it’s a way to express myself. I also used to do a fair bit of android modifications and like to customize
                        my peripherals with nice backgrounds and clean layouts so that they are efficient to use and are easy viewed this is very related to my interest to graphical design. I think both hobbies really come down to the presentation and
                        view of a final product where the aesthetics matter a lot. </p>
                    <p>In projects I tend to take the captain role and try to keep the project on tracks by maintaining the projects vision. This way I keep progress and iterations going, however I’m not afraid to take hard turns and take steps back. This
                        can both be a blessing or a curse for the group as I do help them progress a lot and stay on the topic but I can be quite suborn about this, this shouldn’t be bad however because I feel that’s also part of the design progress.
                        In case I feel like I’m being too stubborn I take no problem in loosening up and keep the group vibe positive.</p>

                    <p> I’m personally very interested in the intersection between technologies and design. I think design can give a lot of purpose to upcoming technologies. Usually new technologies and mechanics tend to be very rough and not user friendly,
                        that’s why I think a design can make or break a product. A designer should be able to make the product more accessible by trying to make it more user-friendly and give it a bit of flair. I’d like to develop a personal design language
                        that’s recognizable to the users but shouldn’t compromise the affordability of the product. The user should feel one with the product and that’s why I think nice ergonomics are a must, the use of more organic shapes should help
                        a lot with that and might engage the user more with the product. When a product is nicely shaped it should be very affordable, users should know how to use my products right out of the box without any literature or tutorials by
                        following what the shape and textures make them do. To achieve these goals, I’m quite a fan of unconvential design as I think current design in for example smartphones is losing it character. An example of this weird approach to
                        design is the pop-up cameras on smartphones, as this overcomes a problem in a rather funny way.</p>
                    <p>I think that with my design I want to connect users to new technologies and ease people’s lives without being too intrusive. This way I make things more accessible for the general public. I want to do this without compromises yet make
                        them available for even the lesser set people. For example, one way I personally do this is by making my phone layouts, by keeping them clean and easy-viewed users will get less overblown with information and technologies, this
                        keeps them calm and eases the use of the product or interface. At last I think my designs should bring emotions to the user so that they can bond to the object. Their purchase should be one of those, I’m very glad I bought this,
                        purchases. I want to achieve this in an ethical way as these products shouldn’t take advantage of the user’s trust.</p>

                <H1>Past</H1>
                <p>I’ve always been intrigued by design and aesthetics rather than auditory stimuli and have primarily focused on those. I’ve spent countless hours mastering adobe software and expressing myself through this medium. My background is technological
                    as this is a subject I’m very interested in and I am willing to spend a lot of time figuring stuff out. I’ve thought about design for a big part of my life as its always been a part of me growing up in Eindhoven. I’ve also thought
                    a lot about psychology, and this is a subject that still interests me a lot.</p>

    <section id="Present ">

            <H1>Present</H1>
            <p>Currently I’m in a big transition where I’m getting more urges to create physical products and spend more time working on the technology and realization of products, for this reason I picked my elective digital craftsmanship this quartile.
                I’ve started to do more personal building projects. Where I for example made myself a keyboard that I designed, and laser cut out of acrylic myself. Another example is my mini project for my course creative electronics where I made a dogfood
                dispenser in the IoT, for this I coded, and 3D modeled quite a lot and got myself a proud final 3D printed result that actually worked.</p>
            <p>I also started to think a lot more about auditory stimuli as I found a lot of research about the importance of audio during my project 1. This subject is something I’ve hadn’t spent so much on in the past but is something I really want to
                improve upon. I’ve started to do more personal building projects. </p>

            <H1>Future</H1>
            <p>Another field I want to build upon in the future is that of business and entrepreneurship. I feel like I’m still very inexperienced in this field and this is something I think I should improve upon; I currently haven’t picked any courses in
                this expertise area yet but I’m planning to do that next year. I’ve been delaying this as I first wanted to more insight on the design process which I have gotten now. I want to use the knowledge of business and entrepreneur ship to investigate
                making more service-oriented designs and business model generation as I think those can be quite important to a product.</p>
